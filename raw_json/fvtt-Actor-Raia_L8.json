        "value": "<p>Raia Danviri was born and raised in the lashunta city-state of Komena, near the southern tip of the continent of Asana on Castrovel. Komena&rsquo;s proximity to the formian-inhabitedcontinent of the Colonies had made it a center of military activity for millennia, constantly besieged by the bug-people as their armies crossed the notoriously embattled chain of islands between continents, laying waste to the landscape in a total war. Yet to the Danviris, it was always a home filled with hope and promise. Raia&rsquo;s parents were diplomats, and they devoted their lives to brokering a peace between the lashuntas and the formians, a goal that spanned decades. They taught their daughter the value of all sentient life, explaining that even among creatures like the insectile formians, who were so unlike lashuntas and had been enemies for so long, one can find similarities&mdash;basic structures like culture, society, and civilization. But even more important in their minds were the differences: the details that separate one species from another not only make them interesting but also can teach the diligent observer incredible new things and inspire one to question and reexamine one&rsquo;s own assumptions and beliefs. In the eyes of the alien, they taught, one can gain new personal insight&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fact that Raia&rsquo;s parents actually succeeded in helping to negotiate peace with the Colonies only reinforced their teachings in the young lashunta&rsquo;s mind. Raia became almost obsessed with alien life-forms. She devoured any texts she could find that described the myriad species that inhabited the worlds beyond Castrovel, and she dreamed of someday traveling among the stars and meeting new species. When she reached puberty, Raia chose to develop into the tall, intellectual damaya subspecies, following the example of her parents, both of whom are damaya.</p>\n<p>When she was old enough, Raia applied to and was accepted into one of Qabarat&rsquo;s famed universities. Her aptitude exams showed a talent for both technology and spellcasting, so she studied the discipline of technomancy, using experimentation to blend science and magic together. At the same time, however, she also excelled in xenobiology and xenoanthropology, applying academic rigor to her childhood passion. During this time, Raia discovered Yaraesa, the lashunta goddess of knowledge and wisdom, whose faith was more akin to the scientific method. Raia wholeheartedly embraced Yaraesa&rsquo;s teachings, seeking self-perfection through the acquisition of knowledge and the development of one&rsquo;s mind and intellect.</p>\n<p>It was also at university that Raia met Danese, an exchange student from Triaxus. Raia was immediately enthralled withthe exotic ryphorian and his silky white fur, but it was Danese&rsquo;s quick wit and keen intellect that turned the initial attraction into something more. Danese was the first &ldquo;alien&rdquo; that Raia befriended, and over the course of innumerable late-night study sessions and heavily armed nature hikes through the nearby jungles, their friendship soon blossomed into love. Raia and Danese were inseparable during their time together at university, but they both knew they would need to reassess their relationship when their studies were complete. Danese had already accepted a commission in the Skyfire Legion and had to return to Triaxus after graduation, while Raia had been accepted into a graduate program on Absalom Station. Danese offered to resign his commission in order to remain with her, but Raia refused to accept that choice. In her opinion, neither of them should have to sacrifice their own advancement and improvement for the sake of the other; instead, each of them should follow Yaraesa&rsquo;s example and figure things out for themselves&mdash;intellectually and spiritually, as well as romantically. They bid each other a tearful farewell and promised to reunite whenever their circumstances allowed.</p>\n<p>After completing her studies, Raia realized that her passion for studying alien life-forms was actually a calling, and her technomantic abilities were the currency she could use to fund her life&rsquo;s work, exchanging her skills as a scientist and technomancer for berths on ships heading out to undiscovered regions of the Vast. Raia believes there is a certain nobility in contacting an alien species for the first time and working to ensure that both they and the peoples of the Pact Worlds advance and improve from the relationship. She seeks out new technology and alternative magical techniques from the aliens she encounters, trading her own knowledge in exchange. Raia doesn&rsquo;t hold to any unrealistic expectation of noninterference in alien cultures, but she believes strongly in doing the right thing and in always striving for honor, compassion, and justice.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite her love of exploration, Raia remains firmly tied to the Pact Worlds. Besides her parents and friends still on Castrovel, Raia still loves Danese, and the two remain committed to one another, even across the vast distances involved in interstellar travel. They stay in regular communication and treasure the infrequent times when their paths bring them physically close to one another. Some day, they might choose to settle down and build a life together, but for now Raia is content. She knows love, her life has purpose and meaning, and the galaxy is filled with an endless number of aliens to discover, befriend, and study&mdash;one species at a time</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p><strong>Amplified Glitch</strong> As a standard action, Raia can cause technological devices to briefly malfunction in loud, distracting ways. She can target four creatures, no two of which can be more than 20 feet apart and all of which must be within 30 feet of a technological device. With a successful Computers check (DC = 15 + 1 per target + 1-1/2 the CR of the highest-CR target), she can cause targets to be shaken for 1 round, plus 1 additional round for every 5 by which she exceeds the check&rsquo;s DC. A creature she targets with this feat is immune to further uses of this feat for 24 hours.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Empowered Weapon</strong> As a move action, Raia can expend a spell slot to grant her weapon a bonus to attacks equal to the level of the spell slot, and her attacks with that weapon deal +1d6 bonus damage per level of spell slot expended. This bonus lasts until the start of her next turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Lashunta Magic</strong> Raia has the following spell-like abilities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Daze: This spell causes a humanoid creature of CR 3 or lower to be dazed for 1 round (Will DC 11 negates).</li>\n<li>Detect Thoughts: Raia can detect the surface thoughts of intelligent creatures within a 60-foot cone, and if she concentrates, she can attempt to read those thoughts (Will DC 12 negates).</li>\n<li>Psychokinetic Hand: Once this spell is cast, as long as Raia concentrates (a standard action each round), she can take a move action to move an object within 35 feet that weighs 10 pounds or less up to 15 feet. She can&rsquo;t perform fine manipulation (such as firing a weapon or using a computer), but she can push a single button or close a container&rsquo;s lid.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Limited Telepathy (Su)</strong> Raia can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30 feet that share a language with her.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Spell Cache (Su)</strong> Raia has an arm implant that functions as her spell cache. Once per day, she can cast one of her spells known even if she has expended all her spell slots of that spell level.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Spells </strong>Raia can cast the following spells as a standard action unless the spell says otherwise.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Comprehend Languages</em>: Raia can understand spoken, signed, or written languages for 40 minutes.</li>\n<li><em>Dancing Lights</em>: Raia can create up to four flashlight-sized lights in a 10-foot-radius area.</li>\n<li><em>Detect Magic</em>: This spell reveals whether creatures or objects seen within a 60-foot cone are magical, and with concentration, can determine whether one magical source is a spell, magic item, or other effect, and its caster level.</li>\n<li><em>Energy Ray</em>: Raia can fire a ray of energy (choose acid, cold, electricity, or fire) as a ranged attack (+5 bonus) that targets EAC and deals 1d3 damage of the chosen energy type.</li>\n<li><em>Flight (1st-Level Spell)</em>: One Medium or smaller falling creature or object per level, all within 20 feet of each other, falls at 60 feet per round and takes no damage when it lands. This spell can be cast as a reaction.</li>\n<li><em>Flight (2nd-Level Spell)</em>: One creature or object (up to 100 pounds/10 bulk per level) within 35 feet moves up or down 20 feet per round, as Kaia directs as a move action.</li>\n<li><em>Ghost Sound</em>: Raia can create an illusory sound (DC 15 to disbelieve) that can be as loud as 20 normal humans.</li>\n<li><em>Grease</em>: Raia can coat a 10-foot square or one object with slippery grease, causing creatures in the area to fall prone or drop the object (Reflex DC 16 partial).</li>\n<li><em>Invisibility</em>: The creature touched is invisible for 4 minutes or until it attacks.</li>\n<li><em>Magic Missile:</em> Raia can fire two missiles of magical energy that automatically hit and deal 1d4+1 force damage each. If she casts this spell as a full action, Raia fires three missiles.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><em>Mending</em>: This spell restores 1d4 HP to one object or construct of up to 1 bulk.</li>\n<li><em>Overheat</em>: This spell deals 2d8 fire damage to creatures in a 15-foot burst (Reflex DC 16 half).</li>\n<li><em>Transfer Charge</em>: Raia can transfer charges between two identical batteries or power cells.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Basic Lashunta Tempweave</strong> While wearing this armor, Raia can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (or other harsh environment) for up to 4 days.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Engineering Tool Kit</strong> These specialized tools allow Raia to attempt Engineering checks without penalty.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 1 Synaptic Accelerators </strong>These implants give Raia an additional +2 to her Intelligence score (already included in her statistics).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 1 Serum of Healing</strong> Drinking a vial of this serum restores 1d8 HP.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Thunderstrike Sonic Pistol</strong> This weapon can be fired 10 times before its battery needs to be recharged or replaced.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

          "value": "<p>Idealized by many other humanoid races and gifted with innate psychic abilities, lashuntas are at once consummate scholars and enlightened warriors, naturally divided into two specialized subraces with different abilities and societal roles.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>To survive on the predator-rich world of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, the telepathic humanoids called lashuntas evolved adaptive genetics that allow children to develop into one of two subspecies, depending on the stresses they endure at puberty: either the tall, intellectual, and adaptable damaya&mdash;who make up most of their race&rsquo;s political leaders and ambassadors&mdash;or the short, burly, headstrong korasha, who excel as warriors and explorers. Both feature short forehead antennae that focus their natural telepathy, as well as colorful swirls and raised markings on their faces unique to each individual. Due to natural pheromones and lashuntas&rsquo; almost perfect physical symmetry, most humanoid races find lashuntas of both subspecies subconsciously (and sometimes unnervingly) attractive.</p>\n<p>Both clades of the species bear the same genetics, allowing them to intermarry and have children. While all lashunta children inherit complexions and certain distinguishing features from their parents, their subspecies is not one of them. Through psychic ritual and force of will techniques applied at puberty, modern lashuntas have mastered the ability to determine what subspecies a child will grow into, activating certain epigenetics and shutting down others. While some lashunta city-states attempt to steer children in particular directions, such as via government-run aptitude tests, most lashuntas believe passionately in a child&rsquo;s right to choose. In ancient lashunta history, their starkly divided gender roles led to subspecies almost universally correlated with gender, but as lashunta culture has grown more egalitarian, gender balance between the two subspecies has become roughly equal.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Lashuntas form the most prominent race on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, and have long been organized into independent city-states for protection against the planet&rsquo;s many apex predators. At the same time, thanks to their large number of magical portals, lashuntas regularly ventured to other worlds even before the advent of space travel, and they have developed particularly close bonds with societies on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Though lashunta societies usually characterize themselves as meritocracies, their leaders have traditionally been women and are usually damaya except in times of war. Both damaya and korasha lashuntas see education as one of the highest callings, making lashunta scholars renowned across the solar system. Military service is also valued, since @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}&rsquo;s dangerous ecosystem and lack of overarching governments mean that settlements need warriors to protect them from jungle monsters. Of these soldiers, the most iconic are the traditional shotalashu cavalry, lightly armored riders who form telepathic bonds with and take their name from their saurian mounts.</p>\n<p>On the whole, lashuntas&rsquo; focus on self-improvement, honor, and communal defense leads them toward good alignments, with damaya tending to be more lawful and korasha more chaotic.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Lashuntas believe that every culture has something to teach, and thanks to the legendary prowess of lashunta diplomats, most other races respect them and consider them allies, or at least reasonable associates. Vesk admire their warriors, androids and kasathas value their logic and learning, and humans respect their scholarship but risk embarrassing themselves trying to deal with lashuntas&rsquo; disconcerting attractiveness. Shirrens are the main exception to this pattern of mutual respect&mdash;though lashuntas&rsquo; millennia of warfare with the insectile formians has finally ended, many lashuntas are still uncomfortable interacting with similar races and worry that &ldquo;the bugs&rdquo; may one day unite against them.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>When a lashunta leaves home, it&rsquo;s often to grow&mdash;in knowledge, prowess, or simple enlightenment. Experience is the best teacher, and the thrill of discovery means that a lashunta adventurer is as likely to be drawn to a new world by a rumor of lost lore as by the promise of wealth. Of course, this quest for wisdom sounds less noble once it&rsquo;s understood that the prestige associated with bringing significant new knowledge home to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} all but assures a lashunta the finest creature comforts for the rest of his life as a corporate consultant or professor at a university. Lashunta adventurers are most frequently envoys, technomancers, and mechanics, but soldiers and operatives are also common, the latter being trained and employed by the numerous powerful lashunta-owned corporations that have surpassed many citystates as the primary political powers on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} and beyond.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Cha, +2 Int, -2 Con<br /><strong>Hit Points&nbsp;</strong>4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>5-7 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>140-180 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity</strong>&nbsp;20 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age </strong>80+2d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Lashuntas are Medium humanoids with the lashunta subtype.</p>\n<h2>Dimorphic</h2>\n<p>All lashuntas gain +2 Charisma at character creation.

Damaya lashuntas are typically clever and well-spoken (+2 Intelligence at character creation) but somewhat delicate (&ndash;2 Constitution at character creation).</p>\n<h2>Lashunta Magic</h2>\n<p>Lashuntas gain the following spell-like abilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>At will</strong> daze, psychokinetic hand</li>\n<li><strong>1/day</strong> detect thoughts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See Spell-like Abilities on page 262. The caster level for these effects is equal to the lashunta&rsquo;s level.</p>\n<h2>Limited Telepathy</h2>\n<p>Lashuntas can mentally communicate with any creatures within 30 feet with whom they share a language. Conversing telepathically with multiple creatures simultaneously is just as difficult as listening to multiple people speaking.</p>\n<h2>Student</h2>\n<p>Lashuntas love to learn, and they receive a +2 racial bonus to any two skills of their choice.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Racial Traits</h1>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 22</em><br />Lashunta variants are less common than the two clades and can be found in both, as represented in the following traits.</p>\n<h2>Psychically Resistant</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 22</em><br />Pre-Gap records show lashuntas lacking telepathy lived in ancient times, and such lashuntas appeared anew at the height of the Formian Wars. These psychically resistant lashuntas emit a low-level psychic static that sometimes leads other members of their naturally telepathic society to exclude them, though such lashuntas are often more skilled in verbal expression. Some can use this static to interfere with nearby telepathy.</p>\n<p>Psychically resistant lashuntas gain a +2 racial bonus to Will saving throws against mind-affecting effects. They can use mental silence once per day as a spell-like ability.</p>\n<p>This replaces lashunta magic and limited telepathy.</p>\n<h2>Rugged</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 22</em><br />Some lashuntas express their species&rsquo; love of learning by focusing on physical training rather than on academic pursuits. A lashunta who has this trait gains Toughness&nbsp;as a bonus feat.</p>\n<p>This replaces student.</p>",

Magic and technology are just tools, and when combined into one discipline, called technomancy, they can be far more powerful than one or the other on its own. You utilize tech to empower, harness, and manipulate magic, and you wield magic to augment, control, and modify technology. You are an expert at hacking the underlying structure of the universe itself, bending the laws of science and nature to your will. Your technomancy—which is gained from scientific study and experimentation—manipulates the physical world, weaves illusions, allows you to peer through time and space, and if necessary, can blast a foe into atoms.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Sl47PwjLhPkni75T]{Spells (Technomancer)}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\">You cast spells drawn from the technomancer spell list (see page 338). To learn or cast a spell, you must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell’s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell’s level + your Intelligence modifier.<br><br>You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day is given on Table 4–10: Technomancer. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have an Intelligence modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 4–11: Technomancer Bonus Spells—note that you only receive these bonus spells once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.<br><br>Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new technomancer level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 4–12: Technomancer Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells you know isn’t affected by your Intelligence modifier.<br><br>Every time you gain a level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.<br><br>You can cast any technomancer spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level. You can also cast a spell using a higher-level spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a spell from a 2nd-level slot instead if you have one.<br><br>You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem. This does not normally invoke the magic contained within, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped spell gem. </span></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.0W6s1XUZdcdNqM78]{Spell Cache (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>As the culmination of your early study of the fundamental forces of the galaxy, you have created a spell cache that allows you to store and access spells. Your spell cache could be a device such as a handheld computer or technological implant; an item such as a ring or staff; or a symbol such as a brand, tattoo, or other permanent modification to your body. While you don’t need your spell cache to cast your spells, once per day, you can activate your spell cache to cast any one spell you know and are capable of casting, even if you’ve expended all your spell slots for that spell’s level.<br><br>If your spell cache is damaged, it is restored to full Hit Points the next time you prepare spells. If the spell cache is lost or destroyed, you can replace it after 1 week with a special ritual that takes 8 hours to complete.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.sobLlAGQkmWcFBFx]{Magic Hack - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>You have carefully studied the forces that define magic and can manipulate them. You learn your first magic hack at 2nd level, and you learn an additional magic hack every 3 levels thereafter. When casting a spell, you can apply no more than one magic hack that affects the attributes of a spell (such as distant spell or extended spell). If a magic hack allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your technomancer level + your Intelligence modifier. The list of magic hacks appears starting on page 120.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.X45ZYqyHHZNakUuY]{Spell Focus - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain Spell Focus as a bonus feat.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.EVMp2EOpASIpIbFQ]{Techlore (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You rewire your mind to give you greater insight into the nature of magic and technology. You gain a +1 insight bonus to Computers and Mysticism checks. This bonus increases by 1 at 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.fE6MHaMJWNki4TP6]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) (Technomancer) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type this class grants you proficiency with.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.pI1KM7WlzxLubzQz]{Cache Capacitor (Su) - 6th Level}</h2>\n<p>You expand your spell cache into a cache capacitor. As part of regaining your spells each day, you can cast a single spell into your spell cache and have it affect you continuously for 24 hours. The cache capacitor can hold any of the following spells: <em>detect radiation</em>, <em>disguise self</em>, <em>keen senses</em>, or <em>unseen servant</em>. You must know a spell to store it in your cache capacitor. When you cast the spell into your cache capacitor, you expend the spell slot normally and make any decisions required for that spell, but the duration doesn’t expire for 24 hours. If the spell in your cache capacitor is dispelled or dismissed, you can spend 5 minutes of uninterrupted concentration to reestablish it, keeping the same decisions you made when you cast it, and gaining whatever duration the spell had remaining. You can’t exchange the stored spell for another spell until you again regains your spells.<br><br>At 12th level, your cache capacitor gains a second slot that can hold <em>darkvision</em>, <em>lesser resistant armor</em>, <em>life bubble</em>, or <em>spider climb</em>.<br><br>At 18th level, your cache capacitor gains a third slot that can hold <em>arcane sight</em>, <em>flight</em> (spell level 3rd or lower), <em>see invisibility</em>, or <em>tongues</em>.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Ja89jy7LlkSG4Zzu]{Resolve Attunement (Ex) - 19th Level}</h2>\n<p>You recover Resolve Points when you use powerful magic. Each time you cast a 6th-level spell, you regain 1 Resolve Point, up to your normal maximum. This applies only to spells you cast using your normal 6th-level spell slots, not to those you cast using magic items or other methods such as fuse spells.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.phzlgejG53nzMKb0]{Fuse Spells (Ex) - 20th Level}</h2>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;You can combine lower-level spell slots to cast higher-level spells. As part of casting a spell, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to exchange a number of unused spell slots for a single spell slot of a higher level; this expends the lower-level spell slots. Add up the levels of the expended slots to determine which higher level of spell you can cast (maximum 6th). For instance, you could exchange three 1st-level slots to cast a 3rd-level spell, or you could exchange two 3rd-level slots to cast a 6th-level spell. If you combine spell slots to cast a 6th-level spell, it doesn’t count as such for resolve attunement.<br><br>Furthermore, you can spend 2 Resolve Points to combine two 6th-level spell slots to cast <em>wish</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Alternate Class Features</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.p5xoDQXN2ZcWuW71]{Cache Augmentation (Ex)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Pf9uh67LQ85K52AF]{Cache Hacks (Su)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Nvh2F2YOmAjRbzOz]{Hack Capacitor (Su)}</p>",

Your spell cache could be a device such as a handheld computer or technological implant; an item such as a ring or staff; or a symbol such as a brand, tattoo, or other permanent modification to your body. While you don’t need your spell cache to cast your spells, once per day, you can activate your spell cache to cast any one spell you know and are capable of casting, even if you’ve expended all your spell slots for that spell’s level.<br><br>If your spell cache is damaged, it is restored to full Hit Points the next time you prepare spells. If the spell cache is lost or destroyed, you can replace it after 1 week with a special ritual that takes 8 hours to complete.</span></p>",

To learn or cast a spell, you must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell’s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell’s level + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"><br>You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day is given on Table 4–10: Technomancer <em>(Below).</em>&nbsp;In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have an Intelligence modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 4–11: Technomancer Bonus Spells <em>(Below) </em>—note that you only receive these bonus spells once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new technomancer level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 4–12: Technomancer Spells Known <em>(Below).</em> Unlike spells per day, the number of spells you know isn’t affected by your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Every time you gain a level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.<br><br>You can cast any technomancer spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level. You can also cast a spell using a higher-level spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a spell from a 2nd-level slot instead if you have one.<br><br>You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem. This does not normally invoke the magic contained within, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped spell gem.</p>\n<h2>Spells Per Day</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"height: 336px;

Failure means the creature can’t move that round and must then succeed at a Reflex save or fall prone, while failure by 5 or more means it falls prone (see the Acrobatics skill on page 135 for details). A creature that doesn’t move on its turn doesn’t need to attempt this check and isn’t considered flat-footed. The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Unattended material objects are always affected by this spell. If you attempt to affect an object in a creature’s possession, the creature can attempt a Reflex save to negate the effect. If the creature fails the initial saving throw, it immediately drops the item and must attempt a new save each round it attempts to pick up, hold, or use the item.

          "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You tinker with the particles of magic surrounding one or more targets to either allow them to slow a fall, gently rise or descend, or fly short or vast distances.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1st:</strong> When you cast flight as a 1st-level spell, you can target one Medium or smaller falling object or creature per level at close range (25 feet + 5 feet/2 levels). The targets must all be within 20 feet of each other. A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as four Medium creatures or objects, and so on. The affected targets instantly fall slower, at a rate of just 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet). The targets take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. This spell doesn&rsquo;t affect charging or flying creatures.For each target, this casting of the spell lasts until that target lands or 1 round per caster level (whichever happens first).<br />The 1st-level version of this spell can be cast as a reaction, but when you do so, you can&rsquo;t take a standard action on your next round.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2nd:</strong> When you cast flight as a 2nd-level spell, you can target yourself or one willing or unconscious creature or unattended object (total weight up to 100 pounds or 10 bulk per level) at close range. The spell allows you to move the target up or down as you wish. Each round as a move action, you can mentally direct the target up or down as much as 20 feet. You can&rsquo;t move the target horizontally. A levitating creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack takes a &ndash;1 penalty to attack rolls, the second a &ndash;2 penalty, and so on, to a maximum of &ndash;5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at &ndash;1.This casting of the spell lasts 1 minute per caster level and is dismissible.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3rd:</strong> When you cast flight as a 3rd-level spell, you can target one willing or unconscious touched creature and give it the power of flight. The target can fly at a speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability. Flying while under this spell&rsquo;s effects takes no more concentration than walking, so the target can attack or cast spells normally. The target can charge but not run, and it can&rsquo;t carry aloft more weight than its normal bulk limit. The target gains a bonus to Acrobatics checks to fly equal to half your caster level.If this spell expires or is dispelled while the target is aloft, the target floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen.The spell lasts for 1 minute per caster level.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4th:</strong> When you cast flight as a 4th-level spell, you can target one willing or unconscious touched creature and affect it as per the 3rd-level version of the spell, except the target&rsquo;s fly speed is increased by 10 feet and the spell lasts for 10 minutes per caster level.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5th:</strong> When you cast flight as a 5th-level spell, you can target yourself and be affected as per the 4th-level version of the spell, except the spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level. When you use this flight speed for long-distance movement, you can hustle without taking nonlethal damage (a forced march still requires Constitution checks). You can cover 140 miles in an 8-hour period of flight (or 80 miles at a speed of 50 feet).</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>6th:</strong> When you cast&nbsp;flight&nbsp;as a 6th-level spell, you can target multiple willing or unconscious creatures at close range (25 feet + 5 feet/2 levels) and affect them as per the 3rd-level version of the spell. You can target one creature per caster level, all of which must be within 30 feet of each other. This casting of the spell lasts 10 minutes per caster level.</li>\n</ul>",

          "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You tinker with the particles of magic surrounding one or more targets to either allow them to slow a fall, gently rise or descend, or fly short or vast distances.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1st:</strong> When you cast flight as a 1st-level spell, you can target one Medium or smaller falling object or creature per level at close range (25 feet + 5 feet/2 levels). The targets must all be within 20 feet of each other. A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as four Medium creatures or objects, and so on. The affected targets instantly fall slower, at a rate of just 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet). The targets take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. This spell doesn&rsquo;t affect charging or flying creatures.For each target, this casting of the spell lasts until that target lands or 1 round per caster level (whichever happens first).<br />The 1st-level version of this spell can be cast as a reaction, but when you do so, you can&rsquo;t take a standard action on your next round.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2nd:</strong> When you cast flight as a 2nd-level spell, you can target yourself or one willing or unconscious creature or unattended object (total weight up to 100 pounds or 10 bulk per level) at close range. The spell allows you to move the target up or down as you wish. Each round as a move action, you can mentally direct the target up or down as much as 20 feet. You can&rsquo;t move the target horizontally. A levitating creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack takes a &ndash;1 penalty to attack rolls, the second a &ndash;2 penalty, and so on, to a maximum of &ndash;5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at &ndash;1.This casting of the spell lasts 1 minute per caster level and is dismissible.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3rd:</strong> When you cast flight as a 3rd-level spell, you can target one willing or unconscious touched creature and give it the power of flight. The target can fly at a speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability. Flying while under this spell&rsquo;s effects takes no more concentration than walking, so the target can attack or cast spells normally. The target can charge but not run, and it can&rsquo;t carry aloft more weight than its normal bulk limit. The target gains a bonus to Acrobatics checks to fly equal to half your caster level.If this spell expires or is dispelled while the target is aloft, the target floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen.The spell lasts for 1 minute per caster level.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4th:</strong> When you cast flight as a 4th-level spell, you can target one willing or unconscious touched creature and affect it as per the 3rd-level version of the spell, except the target&rsquo;s fly speed is increased by 10 feet and the spell lasts for 10 minutes per caster level.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5th:</strong> When you cast flight as a 5th-level spell, you can target yourself and be affected as per the 4th-level version of the spell, except the spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level. When you use this flight speed for long-distance movement, you can hustle without taking nonlethal damage (a forced march still requires Constitution checks). You can cover 140 miles in an 8-hour period of flight (or 80 miles at a speed of 50 feet).</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>6th:</strong> When you cast&nbsp;flight&nbsp;as a 6th-level spell, you can target multiple willing or unconscious creatures at close range (25 feet + 5 feet/2 levels) and affect them as per the 3rd-level version of the spell. You can target one creature per caster level, all of which must be within 30 feet of each other. This casting of the spell lasts 10 minutes per caster level.</li>\n</ul>",

The targets must all be within 20 feet of each other. A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as four Medium creatures or objects, and so on. The affected targets instantly fall slower, at a rate of just 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet). The targets take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. This spell doesn&rsquo;t affect charging or flying creatures.For each target, this casting of the spell lasts until that target lands or 1 round per caster level (whichever happens first).<br />The 1st-level version of this spell can be cast as a reaction, but when you do so, you can&rsquo;t take a standard action on your next round.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2nd:</strong> When you cast flight as a 2nd-level spell, you can target yourself or one willing or unconscious creature or unattended object (total weight up to 100 pounds or 10 bulk per level) at close range. The spell allows you to move the target up or down as you wish. Each round as a move action, you can mentally direct the target up or down as much as 20 feet. You can&rsquo;t move the target horizontally. A levitating creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack takes a &ndash;1 penalty to attack rolls, the second a &ndash;2 penalty, and so on, to a maximum of &ndash;5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at &ndash;1.This casting of the spell lasts 1 minute per caster level and is dismissible.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3rd:</strong> When you cast flight as a 3rd-level spell, you can target one willing or unconscious touched creature and give it the power of flight. The target can fly at a speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability. Flying while under this spell&rsquo;s effects takes no more concentration than walking, so the target can attack or cast spells normally. The target can charge but not run, and it can&rsquo;t carry aloft more weight than its normal bulk limit. The target gains a bonus to Acrobatics checks to fly equal to half your caster level.If this spell expires or is dispelled while the target is aloft, the target floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen.The spell lasts for 1 minute per caster level.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4th:</strong> When you cast flight as a 4th-level spell, you can target one willing or unconscious touched creature and affect it as per the 3rd-level version of the spell, except the target&rsquo;s fly speed is increased by 10 feet and the spell lasts for 10 minutes per caster level.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5th:</strong> When you cast flight as a 5th-level spell, you can target yourself and be affected as per the 4th-level version of the spell, except the spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level. When you use this flight speed for long-distance movement, you can hustle without taking nonlethal damage (a forced march still requires Constitution checks). You can cover 140 miles in an 8-hour period of flight (or 80 miles at a speed of 50 feet).</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>6th:</strong> When you cast&nbsp;flight&nbsp;as a 6th-level spell, you can target multiple willing or unconscious creatures at close range (25 feet + 5 feet/2 levels) and affect them as per the 3rd-level version of the spell. You can target one creature per caster level, all of which must be within 30 feet of each other. This casting of the spell lasts 10 minutes per caster level.</li>\n</ul>",

If no creatures are within the cloud’s area, the microbots pursue and harass the nearest creature that is hostile to you as best they can each round. Although the microbots generally know which creatures are your enemies, you have no control over their targets or direction of travel. If there are multiple valid targets the microbots can harass, the cloud will split into a maximum of four 5-foot-square segments and pursue different targets.<br><br>The cloud (and any segments thereof) has a fly speed of 20 feet. Each round on your turn, the microbot cloud grants harrying fire (see page 247) against the foes in its spaces. In addition, the cloud grants covering fire (see page 246) to anyone attacked by foes in its spaces.

These doubles make it difficult for enemies to precisely locate and attack you.<br /><br />When you cast mirror image, it creates [[1d4]] figment images. These images remain in your space and move with you, mimicking your movements, sounds, and actions exactly. Whenever you are attacked or are the target of a spell that requires an attack roll, there is a possibility that the attack targets one of your images instead. If the attack hits, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. If it is a figment, the figment is destroyed. If the attack misses by 5 or less, one of your figments is destroyed by the near miss, and an attack that misses you due to a miss chance also destroys an image. Area spells and effects that don&rsquo;t require an attack roll affect you normally and don&rsquo;t destroy any of your figments. Spells with a range of touch are harmlessly discharged if used to destroy a figment.<br /><br />An attacker must be able to see the figments to be fooled. If you are invisible or the attacker is blind, the spell has no effect. Blindsense doesn&rsquo;t help distinguish the figments from the real you, but blindsight is sufficient to do so.</p>",

As part of regaining your spells each day, you can cast a single spell into your spell cache and have it affect you continuously for 24 hours. The cache capacitor can hold any of the following spells: <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.spells\" data-id=\"uk49OnFMhCg9CSv1\"> Detect Radiation</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.spells\" data-id=\"HGg3fIQGDzUwueVa\"> Disguise Self</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.spells\" data-id=\"WVlj6EuKGCrjozBH\"> Keen Senses</a>, or <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.spells\" data-id=\"G6q7dYeTZxAvvZlU\"> Unseen Servant</a>. You must know a spell to store it in your cache capacitor. When you cast the spell into your cache capacitor, you expend the spell slot normally and make any decisions required for that spell, but the duration doesn’t expire for 24 hours. If the spell in your cache capacitor is dispelled or dismissed, you can spend 5 minutes of uninterrupted concentration to reestablish it, keeping the same decisions you made when you cast it, and gaining whatever duration the spell had remaining. You can’t exchange the stored spell for another spell until you again regains your spells.<br><br>At 12th level, your cache capacitor gains a second slot that can hold <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.spells\" data-id=\"XZ1X1IzN0tckzOPn\"> Darkvision</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.spells\" data-id=\"nsrp5apjB7X8aOgV\"> Resistant Armor, Lesser</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.spells\" data-id=\"2l5Xk1YMzp0hlUok\"> Life Bubble</a>, or <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.spells\" data-id=\"jA6eTWFaULIpjXAx\"> Spider Climb</a>.<br><br>At 18th level, your cache capacitor gains a third slot that can hold <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.spells\" data-id=\"J6TKSw3AuZfwNW0A\"> Arcane Sight</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.spells\" data-id=\"3MJvj8HOhmqsq2pj\"> Flight</a> (spell level 3rd or lower), <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.spells\" data-id=\"5aW793TGgd3Kd4Fe\"> See Invisibility</a>, or <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.spells\" data-id=\"uWKhr01bnKxuNRkL\"> Tongues</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>",
